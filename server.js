	If we hit save, then the server restarts (note its console message),
	then the list is empty again,
	none of the information is persisting,

    While developing use NODEMON.

The app object has methods for:

Routing HTTP requests; see for example, app.METHOD and app.param.
Configuring middleware; see app.route.
Rendering HTML views; see app.render.
Registering a template engine; see app.engine.
It also has settings (properties) that affect how the application behaves
(for more information, see Application settings)


Basic routing
*************

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request 
to a particular endpoint, 
which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, 
which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure:     app.METHOD( PATH , HANDLER )

- app is an instance of express.
- METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
- PATH is a path on the server.
- HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.


The following examples illustrate defining simple routes.

Respond with Hello World! on the homepage:

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

Respond to POST request on the root route (/), the applicationâ€™s home page:

app.post('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Got a POST request')
})

Respond to a PUT request to the /user route:

app.put('/user', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user')
})

Respond to a DELETE request to the /user route:

app.delete('/user', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Got a DELETE request at /user')
})
